# AGU-SST-PATTERN-MJO-ACTIVITY-BOWDEN
MJO variability, which is defined as MJO amplitude, or activity, is isolated by detrending the data in individual variables, removing the seasonal cycle, and applying a frequency-wavenumber bandpass filter and compares change of projected sea surface temperatures (SST) pattern, precipitable water (TMQ) pattern, and TMQ gradient.
